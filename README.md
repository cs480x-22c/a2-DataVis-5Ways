Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways

# Python & Matplotlib
I've used Python in several courses and am using it right now for MQP as well. It is my favorite language to program in and I feel most comfortable with it. Matplotlib is a plottling library for Python, and I believe this is the first time I've truly used it, I can't recall using it in a prior class honestly. But, I know enough Python I wasn't too worried and it was a little tricky trying to figure out the legends and most of all the colors for the bubble chart. I used the Matplotlib API to better understand what data needed to be input, and used a kanoki article to put the colors into a dictionary with the manufacturers so they would plot correctly.

# Excel 
I've used Excel in a few courses here, and it primarily dealt with data analysis and basic visualization of the data we used in assignments. I never had to make a bubble chart like this before, but was able to find a Youtube video that definitely helped give the right idea. It's been awhile since I used Excel for visualizations, and I sometimes forget how neat the visualizations can look, but I struggled to find a proper way to get the size legend in.

# Tableau
I've never used Tableau before but I have heard of it as a popular data vis software so I wanted to try it out. It was definitely a little bit overwhelming when you first open a workbook as it's something I've never used before, but was able to figure it out a little bit. My one major issue with it was at first, I couldn't edit the axes and the chart was so zoomed in, when I first saved the image it was near impossible to read. But I was able to find a help link, and it turns out I just had to change them from discrete fields to continuous fields, since discrete fields create headers and not axes. So with that change it looked much more like the original visualization. Also, I read that you can't dynamically change color, but I feel the color differences make it relatively easy to distinguish manufacturers apart.
