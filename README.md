# R + ggplot2 

I vizualized the dataset with ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.
This was one of the easier applications to use because it took minimal coding and the legend was generatd automatically. 
There was also no additional formatting of the data needed in order to represent the manufacturer by color, and weight by size.

# d3

I think that this is the visulaization that came out the best. I appended the plot to an svg to display the graph in a browser. I was able to control the colors relatively easliy, as well as format the size of the points with one function. 
One thing I struggle with in using d3 is understanding what attributes go where, but I suppose that comes with experience. 
I have never used d3 before this class, so learning how to do this was a bit of a curve. I primarily referred to these resources when creating my code:
