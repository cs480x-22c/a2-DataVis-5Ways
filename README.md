I used some starter code for the graph's x and y axes and scaling data to the graph. It can be found at the link above. I only used a portion of what is found in the link above, and what I used is both marked down in my .html file and has been changed at least somewhat by me to add necessary elements (such as axes labels) and to ge the margin sizing right, so I can attest to knowing what I was doing.
