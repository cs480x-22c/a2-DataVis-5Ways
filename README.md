**#javascript - d3**

https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_grouped_highlight.html
I used some starter code for the graph's x and y axes and scaling data to the graph. It can be found at the link above. I only used a portion of what is found in the link above, and what I used is both marked down in my .html file and has been changed at least somewhat by me to add necessary elements (such as axes labels) and to ge the margin sizing right, so I can attest to knowing what I was doing.

d3 is the javascript data vis library we're currently using in this class, so it hardly needs an introduction. While I did need some assistance in setting up the graph (see above link and note), I was able to read the data in adn create the chart just fine, and I felt like I had the most creative freedom in terms of what I could do with the chart. I really wanted to animate things, but all I had time to do was make the chart interative by displaying data. The only snag I really hit was that I couldn't read in the .csv file's MODEL.YEAR column when trying to display data on mouseover because of the "."; please don't use "."'s in spreadsheets. Use underscores. It makes life easier.

I could see d3 being useful in the future for pretty much any vis I want to make. It feels powerful, and I know that animations are a very real possibility, even though I haven't figured them out yet. Also, it's convenient that you can just make a vis and then embed it in a website, since everything is done in js/html.

For hacks and manipulations, I was easily able to highlight/unhighlight datapoints on mouseon/mouseoff, but I had a harder time getting text I displayed about the data point to disappear, so I just appended a white rect over the text on mouseoff and called it a day... haha. Also, the legend text took some trial and error, but I eventually got the spacing right. If only I knew d3 a bit better, it could have been much more elegant.

Write a paragraph for each visualization tool you use. What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?

**#python - matplotlib & pandas**

**Flourish**

**#SPSS**

**#java - javafx**
I came VERY close to making JavaFX work, but the libraries do not allow you to color individual points/series... shame
