Hello! For this portion of the assignment, I decided to try Chart JS and D3 integration with React. The results were fair, but you will see that Chart JS integrates much easier with modern frameworks than D3. In addition to that I also made the plot with R and ggplot.

## Chart JS
The integration was easy and smooth, Chart JS already comes with a responsivity and all I needed to make it work was about 200 lines of code.

## D3
The integration was hard, and I needed to create hooks for it so it would work. I also had to use conditional rendering to wait for the state of the data to change so I could call D3.

## ggplot and R
Easiest one! Only a few lines of code to make a good plot
