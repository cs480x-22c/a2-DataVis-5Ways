*R + ggplot2*<br>
R was the language used in one of my previous class. While I don't prefer using it, it only needed a single line of code after everything is properly imported. I used the aesthetic function for the labels. <br>

*Excel*<br>
Spreadsheet apps like Excel are the more traditional tools of data visualization. Thus, it is not as straightforward as some of the other options in the list. The options excel has interms of preset aesthetic is pretty limited in comparison to somthing like Flourish that has more readily available customization options. <br>

*Javascript + D3*<br>
D3 was definintely the option that took the most amount of time to properly set up. Creating the plot was much harder, but it is also mroe customizable. D3 took the most amount of time to even get working. <br>

*Python + Matplotlib*<br>
I am decently experienced using matplot since it was used in my previous math classes often. Thus, creating the graph was quite straightforward and simple. I
utilized pandas which made my life much easier. Customization of matplot is more tedious requiring individual tinkering. <br>

*Flourish*<br>
Flourish was by far the easiest way to create the plot. The options given on the website was easy to used and making my ideas simple to execute. <br>

**Technical Achievements**<br>
I included a legend in most plots. All plots satisfy the requirement. Utilized tools in each ways effectively which reduced the overall workload and improved my effiency as well as made the graph more communicative. For example, utilizing pandas, scaleordial, and preprocessing with skl. <br>

**Design Achievements**<br>
Throughout all the graphs, the color themes are all different making everyone of them pleasant for the eyes and easy to understand. 
In the Flourish visualization, interactability was utitlized to let the user look at specific manufacturers of their choice. By selecting a manufacturer in the legend, all data points for other manufacturers will be hidden. This allows the user to easily identify key information.<br>
