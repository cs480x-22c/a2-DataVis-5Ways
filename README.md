- Data positioning: it should be a downward-trending scatterplot as shown.  Weight should be on the x-axis and MPG on the y-axis.
- Scales: Note the scales do not start at 0.
- Axis ticks and labels: both axes are labeled and there are tick marks at 10, 20, 30, etcetera.
- Color mapping to Manufacturer.
- Size mapping to Weight.
- Opacity of circles set to 0.5 or 50%.
also included: 
legends


Note that some software packages will make it **impossible** to perfectly preserve the above requirements. 
Be sure to note where these deviate.

# R + ggplot2 

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.
