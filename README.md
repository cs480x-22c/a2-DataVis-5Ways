Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

Your goal is to use 5 different tools to make the following chart:

![ggplot2](img/ggplot2.png)

These features should be preserved as much as possible in your replication:

- Data positioning: it should be a downward-trending scatterplot as shown.  Weight should be on the x-axis and MPG on the y-axis.
- Scales: Note the scales do not start at 0.
- Axis ticks and labels: both axes are labeled and there are tick marks at 10, 20, 30, etcetera.
- Color mapping to Manufacturer.
- Size mapping to Weight.
- Opacity of circles set to 0.5 or 50%.

Other features are not required. This includes:

- The background grid.
- The legends.

Note that some software packages will make it **impossible** to perfectly preserve the above requirements. 
Be sure to note where these deviate.

Improvements are also welcome as part of Technical and Design achievements.

Libraries, Tools, Languages


I have marked a few that are strongly suggested.

- R + ggplot2 `<- definitely worth trying`
- Excel
- d3 `<- since the rest of the class uses this, we're requiring it`
- Matplotlib
- three.js `<- well, it's a 3d library. not really recommended, but could be interesting and fun`
- p5js `<- good for playing around. not really a chart lib`
- Tableau
- Java 2d
- GNUplot `<- the CS department head uses this all the time :)`
- Vega-lite <- `<- very interesting formal visualization model; might be the future of the field`
- Flourish <- `<- popular in recent years`
- PowerBI
- SPSS


Readme Requirements
---

A good readme with screenshots and structured documentation is required for this project. 
It should be possible to scroll through your readme to get an overview of all the tools and visualizations you produced.

- Each visualization should start with a top-level heading (e.g. `# d3`)
- Each visualization should include a screenshot. Put these in an `img` folder and link through the readme (markdown command: `![caption](img/<imgname>)`.
- Write a paragraph for each visualization tool you use. What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?
