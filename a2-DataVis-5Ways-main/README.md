# Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  

## Excel
This was harder than I thought it was going to be. I think excel can be pretty annoying at times and I definitly still agree with that after doing this assignment. Though I do this that it was worth the pain because the final graph looks pretty nice. Overall not too bad.

## R
This one went pretty quick as I have used a good amount of R before. If I remember correctly this was like 3-4 lines of code. The final result wasnt the best, mainly because I couldnt figure out the y axis labels, but not too bad considering that it was really easy.

## Python
I though using this was pretty annoying. It seemed that the examples online were out of date or just wrong, or maybe I just really messed up, but it took a while for me to get the formatting right and have it look the way I wanted it to. The end result is pretty good though, and its cool using jypter notebooks in vscode.

## Flourish
This was my favorite by far. Super easy to use, and super fast. Really amazing tool and Im very impressed. Not only was it super easy, but it also resulted in one of the best graphs. Maybe I could have gone a little smaller on the circles though.

## D3
This was funny because of a stupid mistake I made. I did not use a server for the first assignment because everything worked just fine without it. So I started this and it just was not working at all. Took me a while to realize that using the server affects how the d3.csv() function reads off your computer and that was the issue. Oops. Other than that it probably took the longest to make and was the most annoying, but it is what it is. I couldnt really get the axes labels where I wanted them and I had a hard time filtering out those 2 data points at the top with the N/A.

### Technical
Other than adding legends to some of my graphs I just followed the assignment.

### Design
I tried to be consistant across the graphs with the titles and labels, but I didnt do anything too fancy.
