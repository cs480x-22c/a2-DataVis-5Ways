## R Markdown, R, & ggplot Demo A2

This is an R Markdown document. I used to to format this page so you can see what it looks like when you embed R code plots into here, like the cars plot generated in R.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cars_sample <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/a2-DataVis-5Ways/cars-sample.csv")
data <- ggplot(cars_sample, aes(x=Weight, y=MPG, color=Manufacturer, size=Weight), na.rm=TRUE)+geom_point(alpha=0.5)
suppressWarnings(print(data))
```
