This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("magrittr")
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

df_cars <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuniorJedi490/a2-DataVis-5Ways/main/cars-sample.csv")

df_cars %>% ggplot() + geom_point( aes(x=Weight, y=MPG, color=Manufacturer, size=Weight, alpha=0.5) ) + guides(alpha = 'none', color=guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha=0.5)), size=guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha=0.5)), )
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
